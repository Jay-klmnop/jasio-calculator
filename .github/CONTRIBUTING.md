# Filing an Issue

We always encourage users to report bugs as soon as they experience them. In order to keep everything organized here are some questions you should ask yourself before reporting:

## In your issue, please:

- List all operating system names and versions involved in the issue, as well as the toolchain, SDK version, and (if applicable) Xcode version.
- List any other software name/version you think may be related.
- Include any error messages you see.
- List steps to reproduce.

The more information you have, the better. Post as much as you can related to the issues to help us resolve it in a timely matter. If you have multiple issues, please file them as separate issues. This will help us sort them out efficiently.

Don't ask a question not related to the topic of the current issue, especially if it's on someone else's issue. This is known as thread hijacking. You should create a new issue, or ask on another discussion forum. To contact a specific developer, find their GitHub profile and look for their email address, or Twitter, etc.
